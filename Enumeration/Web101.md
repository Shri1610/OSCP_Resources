### Discovery

1. Check the source to potentiolly find 
   - If searching there are parameter (e.g. ?= try LFI)
   - Search for the copyright -> find how old it is
   - Search for php 
     - May need to test https://domain/*index.php*
   - Is there parameter to attack ?


 HTTP Bruteforce

```bash
gobuster dir -u https://target/ -b 403,404 --timeout 30s -t 3 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-files.txt # Enumerate files within the given directory
gobuster dir -u https://target/ -b 403,404 --timeout 30s -t 3 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories-lowercase.txt
gobuster dns -d *domainname* -t 8 -r 8.8.8.8 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt # Enumerate subdomains within the given domain names
```

-b 403,404: While not showing 403,404 pages

*If you don't know, now you know : [HTTP Status Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/service-user-accounts)*

- **1xx**: Informational Codes
- **2xx**: Client Request Successfull
- **3xx**: Request Redirected
- **4xx**: Client Request Incomplete
  - **403** - Forbidden: Access to the requested resource is forbidden
  - **404** - Not Found: The requested document does not exist on the server
- **5xx**: Server Errors


##### Fuzzing

###### Wfuzz

Wfuzz can be used to look for hidden content, such as files and directories, within a web server, allowing to find further attack vectors.

- Passing cookies: -b cookie=value1 -b cookie2=value2
- Adding headers: -H "myheader: headervalue" -H "myheader2: headervalue2"
- Filter options:

Advanced tricks
```bash
wfuzz -z range --zD 0-1 -u http://target/script.php?id=FUZZ
wfuzz -p 127.0.0.1:<BURP_PORT>:HTTP # Add that, if you want to see the requests through a proxy like Burp 
```

###### Fuff

[Fuff](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) is a fast web fuzzer written in Go.

- Filter options:
  - **-fc**:Filter HTTP status codes from response. Comma separated list of codes and ranges
  - **-fl**:Filter by amount of lines in response. Comma separated list of line counts and ranges
  - **-fr**:Filter regexp
  - **-fs**:Filter HTTP response size. Comma separated list of sizes and rangesfw:Filter by amount of words in response. Comma separated list of word counts and ranges

###### GET parameter fuzzing

```bash
ffuf -w /path/to/paramnames.txt -u https://target/script.php?FUZZ=test_value
```

###### POST data fuzzing

```bash
ffuf -w /path/to/postdata.txt -X POST -d "username=admin\&password=FUZZ" -u https://target/login.php
wfuzz -z file,wordlist/others/common_pass.txt -d "username=FUZZ&pass=FUZZ" https://target/login.php
```

###### Cookie fuzzing

```bash
wfuzz -z z,path/to/wordlist.txt -b cookie=FUZZ http://target/
```
